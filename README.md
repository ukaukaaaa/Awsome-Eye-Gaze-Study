### Gaze Generation

**Modeling Human Eye Movements with Neural Networks in a Maze-Solving Task** \
This paper propose a method to generate atial planning task, maze-solving. We collected eye movement
data from human subjects and built deep generative models of eye movements using a
novel differentiable architecture for gaze fixations and gaze shifts. We found that human
eye movements are best predicted by a model that is optimized not to perform the task as
efficiently as possible but instead to run an internal\
